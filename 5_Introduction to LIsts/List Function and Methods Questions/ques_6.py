'''
Start by creating two seperate lists with random numbers. Then,
Creat a third list that merges the numbers from the first and second list together.

'''

list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = [5,6,7,8,9]
# result = []

# for num in list1:
#     result.append(num)
# for num in list2:
#     result.append(num)
# print(result)

result = list1 + list2
print(result)
